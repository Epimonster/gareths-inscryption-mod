## Gareth's Mod
A part 1 booster pack created by Gareth48 and illustrated by Plutraser. Adds 22 cards and 6 sigils designed to fit the balance and design philosophy of vanilla inscryption, with a focus on primarily card flavour, fun and balance.
As a warning you may not encounter every card I've added on a single run, so make sure you keep updating the mod so you don't miss out on the existing cards and future ones! 
Requires CardApi to work

## Installation
For this mod you will need
https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/ - BepInEx

## Known Issues
The "Tasty Morsel" card pool is not every card from act 1, a select few have been removed for balance reasons or to prevent softlocks

If anything breaks or acts unusually while you are testing this mod please feel free to send me a message at Gareth48#3428
Or feel free to message me for any reason at all (I would love to hear about any positive or negative suggestions, balance ideas, etc)


## What's Been Added
6 new custom sigils

Essence Steal - "When a creature bearing this sigil kills another, it transforms into an exact copy of it."

Tasty Morsel - "When a card bearing this sigil dies, a random creature shows up to devour it."

Allies - "When a creature bearing this sigil dies, one of its old allies will temporarily join your hand to avenge it"

Standoffish - "So long as a creature bearing this sigil is opposed by another, it gains 2 attack."

Shove - "When a creature bearing this sigil is played, it will move up to the space opposing it. Creatures that are in the way will be pushed in the same direction. Can't push things that are too heavy (like the Pack Mule and the Moon)"

Hungry - "When a creature bearing this sigil is played choose another friendly creature to eat. The eaten creature will have its health and power added to the creature bearing this sigil."

These sigils will appear in the totem sigil pool

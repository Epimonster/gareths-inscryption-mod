#Gareth's Mod
A part 1 expansion created by Gareth48 and illustrated by Plutraser. Designed to fit the balance and design philosphy of vanilla inscryption, with a focus on primarily card flavour, fun and balance.
As a warning you may not encounter every card I've added on a single run, so make sure you keep updating the mod so you don't miss out on the existing cards and future ones! 
Requires CardApi to work

#Installation
For this mod you will need
https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/ - BepInEx
https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/API_dev/API/ - API
I recommend this tutotial if you are curious how to manually install mods in the first place https://youtu.be/HgCtjtXraog

#Known Issues
The "Essence Steal" sigil cannot transform the bearer into the pack mule or the moon, this is to prevent softlocks
The "Tasty Morsel" card pool is not every card from act 1, a select few have been removed for balance reasons or to prevent softlocks

If anything breaks or acts unusually while you are testing this mod please feel free to send me a message at Gareth48#3428
Or feel free to message me for any reason at all (I would love to hear about any positive or negative suggestions, balance ideas, etc)


#What's Been Added
2 new custom sigils

Essence Steal - "When a creature bearing this sigil kills another, it transforms into an exact copy of it."
Tasty Morsel - "When a card bearing this sigil dies, a random creature shows up to devour it."
Allies - "

These sigils will appear in the totem sigil pool

3 new custom cards

Skinwalker - A rare card that becomes an exact copy of the first card it kills

Wounded Animal -  A defensless common card that summons a random creature to devour it when it dies

Lemming - A brittle common card that summons a random creature to devour it when it dies

Oxpecker - A small flying bird that adds an ally to your hand when it dies

#Future Plans
Planning on trying to update this daily as school (and my brain creating ideas) allows

Planning on adding some more cards based on the above sigils, mainly a larger unit with the allies sigil

#Special Thanks
Various members of the Inscryption modding discord for helping me determine good way to balance these cards, as well as tdl133 specifically for helping me come up with the initial idea for the skinwalker

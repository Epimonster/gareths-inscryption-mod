## Gareth's Mod
WE NOW SUPPORT KAYCEE'S MOD!!!!!

A part 1 booster pack created by Gareth48 and illustrated by Plutraser. Adds 26 cards and 6 sigils designed to fit the balance and design philosophy of vanilla Inscryption, with a focus on primarily card flavor and fun.
As a warning you may not encounter every card I've added on a single run, so make sure you keep updating the mod so you don't miss out on the existing cards and future ones! 

## Installation
For this mod you will need

I recommend this tutorial if you are curious how to manually install mods: https://youtu.be/HgCtjtXraog

## Known Issues
The "Tasty" card pool is not every card from act 1, a select few have been removed for balance reasons or to prevent softlocks

The "Flighty" sigil exhibits strange behavior if Leshy attacks using a creature with it

The "Shove" sigil is untested if Leshy were to play it (this will only happen if you have a randomizer)

If anything breaks or acts unusually while you are testing this mod please feel free to send me a message at @gareth48 on discord
Or feel free to message me for any reason at all (I would love to hear about any positive or negative suggestions, balance ideas, etc)


## What's Been Added
6 new custom sigils

Essence Steal - "When a creature bearing this sigil kills another, it transforms into an exact copy of it."

Tasty - "When a card bearing this sigil dies, a random creature shows up to devour it."

Allies - "When a creature bearing this sigil dies, one of its old allies will temporarily join your hand to avenge it"

Standoffish - "So long as a creature bearing this sigil is opposed by another, it gains 2 attack."

Shove - "When a creature bearing this sigil is played, it will move up to the space opposing it. Creatures that are in the way will be pushed in the same direction. Can't push things that are too heavy (like the Pack Mule and the Moon)"

Hungry - "When a creature bearing this sigil is played choose another friendly creature to eat. The eaten creature will have its health and power added to the creature bearing this sigil."

Flighty - "After a creature bearing this sigil attacks the user chooses a space. The creature will move to that space."

These sigils will appear in the totem sigil pool.

## Future Plans
I intend to maintain compatibility as best I can and I may add some more cards in the future if I have any fun ideas. No promises though!

Looking into adding art/eventual support for Act II integration.
